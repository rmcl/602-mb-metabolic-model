    "\n",
    "As we've learned, organisms convert energy and food into useful molecules and prodigny through series of many individual reactions. Estimating the kinetic parameters for each of these reactions under the varying conditions within in a cell is often impractical. Flux based models use stoicheometry of the reactions and some complicated math (linear optimization) to predict the concentrations of metabolites and the \"flux\" through reactions.\n",

    "1. Input all of the known reactions of an organism into the model in terms of their stoicheometry. For instance,"
